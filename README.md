# Vampire Survivors Ref-Compilation Project
A repository with decompiled source code for the game Vampire Survivors interpreted from IL2Cpp assembly. 
Exists purely for reference for mod support, and will be taken down if the devs ask me to.
Seperated into two parts: The scaffold, which only contains the prototypes for the classes, and the reference, which actually contains code.
### Note: This reference is PURELY for modding usage, and is not intended to be used for anything else. The code contained is my personal interpretation based on what I have decompiled, and is not necessarily one to one with the actual source code of the game.
